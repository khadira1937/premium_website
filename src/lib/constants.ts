    question: "What is IPTV and how does it differ from traditional TV?",
    answer:
      "IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) delivers television content over your internet connection rather than through a traditional aerial, satellite dish, or cable. You can watch live TV, on-demand films, and catch-up content on any internet-connected device — from Smart TVs and streaming sticks to phones and laptops. The experience is very similar to services like Sky Go or BBC iPlayer, but with a much wider channel selection at a lower price.",

  {
    question: "Which devices can I use?",
    answer:
      "Our service works on Amazon Firestick, Android TV boxes, Android phones and tablets, iPhones and iPads, Samsung/LG/Sony Smart TVs, Windows and Mac computers, MAG devices, and Enigma2 receivers. You can use any IPTV-compatible app including IPTV Smarters Pro, TiviMate, or Smart IPTV.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will I receive access after payment?",
    answer:
      "Access is activated within minutes. You will receive your login credentials by email and WhatsApp immediately after your payment is confirmed. Our team is available 24/7 to ensure fast activation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I am not satisfied?",
    answer:
      "You are covered by our 30-day money-back guarantee. If the service does not meet your expectations for any reason, contact our support team and we will process a full refund — no questions asked.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I watch on more than one device at the same time?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The number of simultaneous connections depends on your plan: Monthly supports 1 device, 3-Month supports 2 devices, and the Annual plan supports up to 3 devices simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the connection stable? Will I experience buffering?",
    answer:
      "Our service boasts 99.9% uptime with anti-freeze technology. We use premium, UK-optimised servers to ensure smooth, buffer-free streaming. A stable broadband connection of at least 10 Mbps is recommended for the best HD/4K experience.",

      "We carry every major British broadcaster — BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky, TNT Sports, and more — plus comprehensive sports coverage (Sky Sports, Premier League, Champions League, F1, cricket), cinema channels (Sky Cinema), kids' channels (CBeebies, CBBC, Cartoon Network), and thousands of international channels.",
